Hi, I’m Neeraj.

I work in capital project management and I build practical AI tools focused on real world problems.

My background is in healthcare and public sector projects, where I’ve managed equipment sourcing and delivery for projects valued at $10M+ across multiple sites in Canada.

What I’m interested in:
- AI assisted decision tools
- Simple automation over complex systems
- Canada focused data, infrastructure, and compliance aware solutions

What I build:
- Small, working tools with clear scope
- MVPs that solve one problem end to end
- Systems designed with project constraints in mind

Find my projects at: https://github.com/NeerajMohanty/applied-ai-projects

Tech I use:
- No code and low code tools when they make sense: Cursor, Bolt.new, Replit, Claude Code
- Python
- AWS Lambda
- APIs
- OpenAI

This GitHub is a record of what I build, test, and learn.
